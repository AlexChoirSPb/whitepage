			 Terms of Service
		</h1>
		<p>
			This Terms of Service was last modified on January 09, 2023.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Terms and conditions</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			These terms and conditions (“Terms and Conditions”) apply to your use of all ANKART websites, applications, services and products (“Services” or individually a “Service”) that post a link to these Terms and Conditions and that are provided by any ANKART group company worldwide ("ANKART", "we", "us" or "our").
			<br>
			<br>
			By accessing or using any of the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. These Terms and Conditions expressly incorporate by reference and include the Service's Privacy Policy and any guidelines, policies or additional terms or disclaimers that may be posted and/or updated on the Service or on notices that are sent to you. If you do not agree with these Terms and Conditions, please do not use the Services.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Using our services</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			Unless otherwise set out herein, content comprised within the Services, including text, graphics, user interfaces, visual interfaces, photographs, trademarks, logos, videos, audio, images, applications, programs, computer code and other information (collectively, the "Content"), including but not limited to the design, layout, “look and feel” and arrangement of such Content, is owned by ANKART, its licensors or its content providers and is protected by copyright, trademark and other intellectual property and unfair competition laws.
			<br>
			<br>
			Except as otherwise provided in any additional terms for a Service, you may print or download Content from the Services for your own personal, non-commercial, informational or scholarly use, provided that you keep intact all copyright and other proprietary notices.
			<br>
			<br>
			You may not copy, display, distribute, modify, publish, reproduce, store, transmit, post, translate or create other derivative works from, or sell, rent or license all or any part of the Content, or products or services obtained from the Services, in any medium to anyone, except as otherwise expressly permitted under these Terms and Conditions, or any relevant license or subscription agreement or authorization by us.
			<br>
			<br>
			You may not reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile or translate any software in the Content, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of such software, except to the extent expressly permitted under applicable law, without our prior written permission. You may not engage in the systematic retrieval of Content from the Services to create or compile, directly or indirectly, a collection, compilation, database or directory without our prior written permission.
			<br>
			<br>
			You may not use any robots, spiders, crawlers or other automated downloading programs, algorithms or devices, or any similar or equivalent manual process, to: (i) continuously and automatically search, scrape, extract, deep link or index any Content; (ii) harvest personal information from the Services for purposes of sending unsolicited or unauthorized material; or (iii) cause disruption to the working of the Services or any other person’s use of the Services. If the Services contain robot exclusion files or robot exclusion headers, you agree to honor them and not use any device, software or routine to bypass them. You may not attempt to gain unauthorized access to any portion or feature of the Services, any other systems or networks connected to the Services or to any ANKART server, or any of the products or services provided on, accessed from or distributed through the Services. You may not probe, scan or test the vulnerability of the Services or any network connected to the Services or breach or attempt to breach the security or authentication measures on the Services or any network connected to the Services.
			<br>
			<br>
			You may not, without the approval of ANKART, use the Services to publish or distribute any advertising, promotional material, or solicitation to other users of the Services to use any goods or services. For example (but without limitation), you may not use the Services to conduct any business, to solicit the performance of any activity that is prohibited by law, or to solicit other users to become subscribers of other information services. Similarly, you may not use the Services to download and redistribute public information or shareware for personal gain or distribute multiple copies of public domain information or shareware.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Content provided to us or posted on or through the service</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			Some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content. Except as otherwise provided in any additional terms or agreements for or relating to a Service, we do not claim ownership of any content, application or other material that you or third parties provide to us (including feedback and suggestions) or post, upload, input or submit on or through the Services, including our blog pages, message boards, comment or discussion features, chat rooms and forums, for review by ANKART and its suppliers or licensors, the general public, registered users of the Services, or by the members of any public or private community ("Submission"), and you retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in the Submission. We are not responsible for the content, accuracy or compliance with relevant laws or regulations of any Submission that contains content that is not owned by ANKART. However, by posting, uploading, inputting, providing or submitting ("Posting") a Submission, and except to the extent that any Submission is to be treated as confidential as part of our policies, you grant us (and those we work with) a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive right and license to publish, post, reformat, index, archive, make available, link to, and otherwise use such Submission in all forms and media (whether now known or later developed), in connection with the operation of our respective businesses (including, without limitation, the Services) and to permit others to do so. You shall not make any Submission anonymously, and you warrant and represent that any such Submission is original, and has been written by you. We are under no obligation to display or otherwise use any Submission you may provide, and we may remove any Submission at any time in our sole discretion. By Posting such a Submission, you also warrant and represent that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to your Submission including, without limitation, all the rights necessary for granting the permission specified above.
			<br>
			<br>
			You may not use the Services to publish or distribute any information (including software or other content) which is illegal, which violates or infringes upon the rights of any other person, which is defamatory, abusive, hateful, profane, pornographic, threatening or vulgar, which contains errors, viruses or other harmful components, or which is otherwise actionable at law. ANKART may at any time exercise editorial control over the Content of the Services.
			<br>
			<br>
			We shall have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor Submissions to determine compliance with these Terms and Conditions and any operating rules we establish and to satisfy any law, regulation or authorized government request. We shall have the right in our sole discretion to edit, refuse to post, or remove any Submission.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Links</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			The Services may contain links to third-party sites or resources. We do not endorse and are not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products or other materials on or available from external sites or resources linked to the Services. Transactions that occur between you and any third party are strictly between you and the third party and are not the responsibility of ANKART.
			<br>
			<br>
			ANKART welcomes you to link to the Services. You may establish a hypertext link to the Services, provided that the link does not state or imply any sponsorship or endorsement of your site, company, product and/or service by ANKART. You may not use on your site any trademarks, service marks or copyrighted materials appearing on the Services, including but not limited to any logos, without the express written consent or an explicit license of the owner of the mark or right. You may not frame or otherwise incorporate into another site any of the Content or other materials on the Services without prior written consent of ANKART.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Disclaimer of warranties and liability</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			We provide the Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care, but neither ANKART nor its suppliers or licensors make any specific promises about the Services, including the Content or any Submission therein. For example, we don’t make any commitment that the operation of the Services will be uninterrupted or error-free; that any defects will be corrected; that the Services, including the server that makes them available, are free of viruses or other harmful components; or as to the accuracy, completeness, reliability, availability, suitability, quality, non-infringement, operation or result obtained from the use of any Content or Submission provided on, accessible from or distributed through the Services.
			<br>
			<br>
			ANKART AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND LICENSORS PROVIDE THE SERVICES AND ALL CONTENT AND ANY SUBMISSION INCLUDED IN OR ACCESSIBLE FROM THE SERVICES "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND (EXPRESS, IMPLIED AND STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF TITLE AND NONINFRINGEMENT AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE), ALL OF WHICH ANKART AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND LICENSORS DISCLAIM TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES AND ALL CONTENT AND SUBMISSIONS, INCLUDED IN OR ACCESSIBLE FROM THE SERVICES ARE AT YOUR SOLE RISK.
			<br>
			<br>
			To the extent permitted under applicable law, neither ANKART nor its suppliers and licensors assume responsibility for any injury and/or damage to persons, animals or property as a matter of products liability, malpractice, failure to warn, negligence or otherwise, or from any use or operation of any ideas, instructions, methods, tests, products or procedures displayed on the Services or incorporated in the Content or any Submission included in or accessible from the Services. Practitioners and researchers must rely on their own experience, knowledge and judgment in evaluating or applying any information, which remains their professional responsibility.  Because of rapid advances in the medical sciences and changes in government regulations and clearances, we recommend that independent verification of diagnoses, treatments, indications choice of drugs and drug dosages should be made. Discussions, views, and recommendations expressed may not be considered absolute and universal for every situation. ANKART remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations. ANKART will not be liable for the failure by any user of the Services, Content or Submission to use due care in the use and validation of results made available through the Services or included in the Content or any Submission, nor will ANKART be liable for any medical treatment provided by users to their patients, whether or not the Services, Content or Submission were used in connection with such treatment.
			<br>
			<br>
			TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL ANKART OR ITS SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR SIMILAR DAMAGES, PERSONAL INJURY (INCLUDING DEATH), LOSS OF PROFITS, CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES OR THE CONTENT OR SUBMISSIONS, OR SHALL THE LIABILITY OF ANKART OR ITS SUPPLIERS AND LICENSORS EXCEED A SUM EQUAL TO THE FEES PAID BY YOU HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
			<br>
			<br>
			ANKART does not claim ownership, endorse or take responsibility for any third-party products, information, guidelines, materials or services that may be offered, advertised, provided or displayed on the Service or incorporated in the Content or any Submission contained on, accessible from or distributed through the Services.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Indemnification</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			You hereby agree to indemnify and hold ANKART, its directors, officers, shareholders, predecessors, successors in interest, employees, agents, suppliers and licensors harmless from and against any and all third-party claims of liability, losses, damages and costs, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' or legal fees, arising out of or in connection with your violation of these Terms and Conditions, and your use of or inability to use any of the Services or the Content or Submissions.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Registered user grant of license</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			Some sites may require you to register. If registration is required, you agree to provide accurate and complete registration information. It is your responsibility to inform ANKART of any changes to that information. Each registration is for a single individual only, unless specifically designated otherwise on the registration page. ANKART does not permit a) anyone other than you to use the sections requiring registration by using your name or password; or b) access through a single name being made available to multiple users on a network or otherwise. As a registered user of a Service, ANKART grants to you a non-transferable, non-exclusive and revocable license to use the Service according to these Terms and Conditions. Except as expressly granted herein or in any other agreement you have with ANKART, you acquire no right, title or license in the Service or any Content or Submission accessed from or incorporated in the Service.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Password use and security</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			If you use a password to access a Service, you must not reveal your password and must take reasonable steps to keep your password confidential and secure. You agree to immediately notify ANKART if you become aware of or have reason to believe that there is any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security. ANKART is in no way liable for any claims or losses related to the use or misuse of your password or account due to the activities of any third party outside of our control or due to your failure to maintain their confidentiality and security.
